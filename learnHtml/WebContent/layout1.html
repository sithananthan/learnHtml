		<h1>Aruvi Iyarkai Sandhai</h1>
		<p>Aruvi iyarkai sandhai is an organic store which is based out of
			Puducherry. It was started on Jan 2018, and its main moto is to sell
			organic produce in an affordable price and it should be available to
			all the people. The products especially fruits and vegetables are
			locally produced by local farmers. They use no chemical fertilizer in
			their farming technique and hence all the products we sell are
			completely natural and organic one.</p>

		<h1>We Plant our future</h1>
		<p>Today's children doesnt like to play outside or in sun, like
			previous generatio did. They have very less knowledge about food they
			eat, how is it grown and less awareness about environment. This
			Project is to help kids from urban school to learn about food and
			agriculture. This would be part of their daily curriculum. So learn
			Maths and science concepts through agriculture.</p>
